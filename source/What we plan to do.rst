Things to improve
------


Here is a short list of the things we spotted as "imporvable"

* Checking if the area the user request exists and avoid the crash of our code in case of error

* Binding the date legend to the date layer

* Retrieving the list of Flinnâ€“Engdahl regions from a website instead of a static file

* Adding the date of creation to each map
