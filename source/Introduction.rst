Introduction
------

The point of this document is to summarize and describe what has been done as part of the "GeoSpatial Data Management" class.


The purpose of this teaching unit is to propose an introduction to the management of geospatial data to the student of the Polytechnic Faculty of Mons. The course has been spread over 11 weeks at the rate of roughly 4 hours of grouped work each week.

Given the complexity and the width of this field of study, the class sessions objective is to give the student hints on some ways to deal with large amount of geospatial data. Then, the students are supposed to form themselve as much as possible and gather information over the subjects that have been touched on during the class sessions.



In order to restrict the amount of things to study in this short period of time, the students are broughts to define a final project.
Then they can use this as a guidance thread to lead their researches.



This document will resume the approach of the students that chose the following project :


			**Use python packages to display an interactive map with data provided by EMSC**


Here is an example of the kind of map they managed to build.
